# Bootleg Postman 
By Avaneesh Buddha and Nitish Bachala

This application, _Bootleg Postman_, is a personal project where we created a full stack project which created a interactive front-end that communicates with a back-end database - MongoDB Atlas. 

We made this application using: 
Languages: 
  HTML 
  CSS 
  JS
 
Frameworks:
  Node.js 
  Express
  MongoDB/Mongo Client
  CORS unblock chrome extention 
  
Database: 
  MongoDB Atlas (stored on AWS)


Motivations behind this project: 
  Inspired by ACM projects presentation night, where many very diverse applications were made through the use of API's, we were inspired to create a project where we implemented user-interaction and API implementation. Avaneesh focused on front-end User experience design and Nitish focused on the back-end with API implementation, and integration with front-end. 

Initial project ideation: 
  We planned to use external API's to create a tinder like app which shows the user a continues scroll of startup companies to invest in. The user can personalize their tastes and find those startup companies that fit their tastes to invest in. 
  
Obstacles during this project: 
  Initially we had four members on team, but there were a lot of problems associated with team dynamics and planning that we did not take care of. 
  Planning: 
    - The plan was very optimistic
    - lacked appropriate meetings to make sure that team members were on track. 
    - Had to pivot the project due to being severely behind on schedule 
  Team Dynamics: 
    - Team did not have aligned motivations and goals 
    - Ignored team bonding 
    - Lack of team charter 
    - Lack of accountability 
    - Little understanding of Strengths and Weaknesses 
  We lacked a Mentor: 
    - When we ran into costly technical problems(in terms of productivity), that took long hours of debugging and researching to solve
