# Bootleg Postman 
By Avaneesh Buddha and Nitish Bachala

This application, _Bootleg Postman_, is a personal project where we created a full stack project with an interactive front-end that communicates with a back-end database - MongoDB Atlas. 

We made this application using: 
Languages: 
  HTML 
  CSS 
  JS
 
Frameworks:
  Node.js 
  Express
  MongoDB/Mongo Client
  CORS unblock chrome extension 
  
Database: 
  MongoDB Atlas (stored on AWS)

How to navigate the website: 
  There are four operations possible:
  - Get: Get all the data in the database
  - Post: Post a new JSON object into the database
  - Patch: Update a JSON object in the database
  - Delete: Delete a JSON object in the database 
  You can navigate these pages using the top bar with the respective button. 
  
  Some pages have two possible operations, so it is easier to find the ID of particular objects when Patching and Deleting objects. 

Motivations behind this project: 
  Inspired by ACM projects presentation night, where many very diverse applications were made through APIs, we were inspired to create a project where we implemented user interaction and API implementation. Avaneesh focused on front-end User experience design, and Nitish concentrated on the back end with API implementation and integration with the front end. 

Initial project ideation: 
  We planned to use external APIs to create a tinder-like app that shows the user a continuous scroll of startup companies to invest in. The user can personalize their tastes and find those startup companies that fit their preferences to invest in. 
  
Obstacles during this project: 
  Initially, we had four members on the team, but there were a lot of problems associated with team dynamics and planning that were not taken care of. 
  Planning: 
    - The plan was very optimistic
    - lacked appropriate meetings to make sure that team members were on track. 
    - Had to pivot the project due to being severely behind schedule 
  Team Dynamics: 
    - Did not have aligned motivations and goals 
    - Ignored team bonding 
    - Lack of team charter 
    - Lack of accountability 
    - Little understanding of Strengths and Weaknesses 
  We lacked a Mentor: 
    - When we ran into costly technical problems(in terms of productivity) that took long hours of debugging and researching to solve
